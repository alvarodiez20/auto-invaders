## 📖 Story

> **Year 2187 - The Outer Rim**
>
> You are the last Operator of the **A.I.S. (Automated Interception System)**, a prototype defense platform stationed at the edge of known space. When the Scrap Swarm—an endless tide of autonomous salvage drones gone rogue—began sweeping through colonial space, humanity's only hope became this single, underfunded station.
>
> At first, you must do everything manually: aim, fire, dodge. But as you destroy enemies and collect **Scrap**, you'll upgrade your ship with increasingly powerful automation systems. Your goal? Transform from a desperate "trigger-clicker" into a fully automated defense grid capable of holding back the swarm.
>
> Survive 6 sectors. Defeat 6 sector bosses. Save humanity—one upgrade at a time.
